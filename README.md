# NIMCE
NIMCE is a network inference method based on information-theoretic to reconstruct GRNs.

# Usage

  In this GitHub project, we give a demo to show how NIMCE works. In this project, we give three datasets we used in our study.
  
  example:insilico_size100_1_timeseries.mat is the gene expression matrix with matlab format.Its shape is 210 samples (10 samples x 21 time point) x 100 genes.
  
  The rum_main.m show an example to use NIMCE.
  
  The other details can see the paper and the codes.
